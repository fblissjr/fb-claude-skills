          "content_preview": "Reference for Claude Code hook events, configuration schema, JSON input/output formats, exit codes, async hooks, prompt hooks, and MCP tool hooks.\n\n<Tip>\n  For a quickstart guide with examples, see [Automate workflows with hooks](/en/hooks-guide).\n</Tip>\n\nHooks are user-defined shell commands or LLM prompts that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. Use this reference to look up event schemas, configuration options, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks and MCP tool hooks. If you're setting up hooks for the first time, start with the [guide](/en/hooks-guide) instead.\n\n## Hook lifecycle\n\nHooks fire at specific points during a Claude Code session. When an event fires and a matcher matches, Claude Code passes JSON context about the event to your hook handler. For command hooks, this arrives on stdin. Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and optionally return a decision. Some events fire once per session, while others fire repeatedly inside the agentic loop:\n\n<div>\n  <Frame>\n    <img alt=\"Hook lifecycle diagram showing the sequence of hooks from SessionStart through the agentic loop to SessionEnd\" />\n  </Frame>\n</div>\n\nThe table below summarizes when each event fires. The [Hook events](#hook-events) section documents the full input schema and decision control options for each one.\n\n| Event                | When it fires                                                      |\n| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `SessionStart`       | When a session begins or resumes                                   |\n| `UserPromptSubmit`   | When you submit a prompt, before Claude processes it               |\n| `PreToolUse`         | Before a tool call executes.

          "content_preview": "Run shell commands automatically when Claude Code edits files, finishes tasks, or needs input. Format code, send notifications, validate commands, and enforce project rules.\n\nHooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. They provide deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them. Use hooks to enforce project rules, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate Claude Code with your existing tools.\n\nFor decisions that require judgment rather than deterministic rules, you can also use [prompt-based hooks](#prompt-based-hooks) or [agent-based hooks](#agent-based-hooks) that use a Claude model to evaluate conditions.\n\nFor other ways to extend Claude Code, see [skills](/en/skills) for giving Claude additional instructions and executable commands, [subagents](/en/sub-agents) for running tasks in isolated contexts, and [plugins](/en/plugins) for packaging extensions to share across projects.\n\n<Tip>\n  This guide covers common use cases and how to get started. For full event schemas, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks and MCP tool hooks, see the [Hooks reference](/en/hooks).\n</Tip>\n\n## Set up your first hook\n\nThe fastest way to create a hook is through the `/hooks` interactive menu in Claude Code. This walkthrough creates a desktop notification hook, so you get alerted whenever Claude is waiting for your input instead of watching the terminal.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Open the hooks menu\">\n    Type `/hooks` in the Claude Code CLI. You'll see a list of all available hook events, plus an option to disable all hooks. Each event corresponds to a point in Claude's lifecycle where you can run custom code. Select `Notification` to create a hook that fires when Claude needs your attention.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Configure the matcher\">\n    The menu shows a list of matchers, which filter when the hook fires. Set the matcher to `*` to fire on all notification types. You can narrow it later by changing the matcher to a specific value like `permission_prompt` or `idle_prompt`.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add your command\">\n    Select `+ Add new hook…`. The menu prompts you for a shell command to run when the event fires. Hooks run any shell command you provide, so you can use your platform's built-in notification tool. Copy the command for your OS:\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"macOS\">\n        Uses [`osascript`](https://ss64.com/mac/osascript.html) to trigger a native macOS notification through AppleScript:\n\n        ```\n        osascript -e 'display notification \"Claude Code needs your attention\" with title \"Claude Code\"'\n        ```\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title=\"Linux\">\n        Uses `notify-send`, which is pre-installed on most Linux desktops with a notification daemon:\n\n        ```\n        notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Claude Code needs your attention'\n        ```\n      </Tab>\n\n      <Tab title",

          "content_preview": "Create custom plugins to extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.\n\nPlugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.\n\nLooking to install existing plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins). For complete technical specifications, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).\n\n## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration\n\nClaude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:\n\n| Approach                                                    | Skill names          | Best for                                                                                        |\n| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)                       | `/hello`             | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments                          |\n| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |\n\n**Use standalone configuration when**:\n\n* You're customizing Claude Code for a single project\n* The configuration is personal and doesn't need to be shared\n* You're experimenting with skills or hooks before packaging them\n* You want short skill names like `/hello` or `/review`\n\n**Use plugins when**:\n\n* You want to share functionality with your team or community\n* You need the same skills/agents across multiple projects\n* You want version control and easy updates for your extensions\n* You're distributing through a marketplace\n* You're okay with namespaced skills like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)\n\n<Tip>\n  Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you're ready to share.\n</Tip>\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThis quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom skill. You'll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a skill, and test it locally using the `--plugin-dir` flag.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Claude Code [installed and authenticated](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code)\n* Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (run `claude --version` to check)\n\n<Note>\n  If you don't see the `/plugin` command, update Claude Code to the latest version. See [Troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting) for upgrade instructions.\n</Note>\n\n### Create your first plugin\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the plugin directory\">\n    Every plugin lives in its own directory containing a manifest and your skills, agents, or hooks.

Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.\n\n<Note>\n  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see [interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands).\n\n  **Custom slash commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.\n</Note>\n\nClaude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools.

Since it uses default frontmatter, Claude can load it automatically when you ask how something works, or you can invoke it directly with `/explain-code`.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the skill directory\">\n    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.\n\n    ```bash theme={null}\n    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write SKILL.md\">\n    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.\n\n    Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ```yaml theme={null}\n    ---\n    name: explain-code\n    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks \"how does this work?\"\n    ---\n\n    When explaining code, always include:\n\n    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life\n    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships\n    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens\n    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?\n\n    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test the skill\">\n    You can te",

Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent's description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results.\n\n<Note>\n  If you need multiple agents working in parallel and communicating with each other, see [agent teams](/en/agent-teams) instead. Subagents work within a single session; agent teams coordinate across separate sessions.\n</Note>\n\nSubagents help you:\n\n* **Preserve context** by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation\n* **Enforce constraints** by limiting which tools a subagent can use\n* **Reuse configurations** across projects with user-level subagents\n* **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains\n* **Control costs** by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku\n\nClaude uses each subagent's description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.\n\nClaude Code includes several built-in subagents like **Explore**, **Plan**, and **general-purpose**. You can also create custom subagents to handle specific tasks.
